## 👋 Welcome to our project!

We are a group of enthusiastic individuals who have come together in our free time to create a website for the "Sterczące Uszy" foundation 🐶

This non-profit organization helps animals in difficult situations or those who are homeless find new homes.

## 🎯 Project Goals

Our aim is to create a fully functional and visually appealing website for Sterczące Uszy foundation.

We want to make it easy for people to learn about the organization and its mission, as well as showcase the animals available for adoption.

Additionally, we hope to help the foundation gain more support and donations through our website.

## 🤝 Contribution

This project is a pro bono effort, and we are constantly learning and improving as we work on it. 

If you're interested in contributing to our project, please feel free to reach out to us! 

We welcome all types of contributions, from design to development and everything in between.
